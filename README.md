# learning
This is a project aimed at learning mechanics and dynamics via matlab,mathematica and python(jupyter notebook))

Hello,as you see,I'm a student at grade 3 in Nuaa(Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics).My major is the desgning and engineering of aircraft together with airworthiness.

Though my major has little to do with coding,I find it really enrich my learning experience and help me solve problems.For my major require much knowledge of mechanics and dynamics(This term I take 5 courses about this field),I tried to code to organize my knowledge and to solve problems on text books.

My coding ability may be not that good as well as my English expression.So I'd like to practice via this project.I will focus on code via matlab(.xls),mathematica(.nb,usually called mma) and python(.ipynb/.py).If you have some advice or better idea,wellcome to communicate with me.My email-address is :bcynua@163.com.

I'm eager to have workmates to learn mechanics and dynamics with me together!
